# OpenPlaning

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/openplaning/badge/?version=latest)](https://openplaning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

OpenPlaning is a Python library for the hydrodynamic evaluation of planing hulls based on the Savitsky empirical methods.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install openplaning.

```bash
pip install openplaning
```

## Examples

You can run the example below, plus an optimization case study, online with Binder:
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/elcf/binder-openplaning/main?filepath=OpenPlaningExamples.ipynb)

```python
from openplaning import PlaningBoat

#Vessel particulars (from the Savitsky '76 example)
speed = 13.07 #m/s
weight = 827400 #N
beam = 7.315 #m
length = 24.38 #m, vessel LOA
lcg = 10.67 #m, long. center of gravity
vcg = beam/7 #m, vert. center of gravity
r_g = 0.25*length #m, radius of gyration
beta = 15 #deg, deadrise

#Propulsion
epsilon = 0 #deg, thrust angle w.r.t. keel
vT = vcg #m, thrust vertical distance
lT = lcg #m, thrust horizontal distance

#Trim tab particulars
sigma = 1.0 #flap span-hull beam ratio
delta = 5 #deg, flap deflection
Lf = 0.3048 #m, flap chord

#Seaway
H_sig = 1.402 #m, significant wave height

#Additional options
LD_change = 0 #Roughness induced change of hull lift to change of hull drag ratio (dimensionless). Defaults to -1.1 (ITTC '78 foil section value).
wetted_lengths_type = 3 #1 = Use Faltinsen 2005 wave rise approximation, 2 = Use Savitsky's '64 approach, 3 = Use Savitsky's '76 approach. Defaults to 1.
roughness_penalty_type = 2 #1 = Use Mosaad's '86 regression, 2 = Use Townsin's '84 regression. Defaults to 1.

#Create boat object
boat = PlaningBoat(speed, weight, beam, lcg, vcg, r_g, beta, epsilon, vT, lT, length, H_sig, LD_change=LD_change, Lf=Lf, sigma=sigma, delta=delta, wetted_lengths_type=wetted_lengths_type, roughness_penalty_type=roughness_penalty_type)

#Calculates the equilibrium trim and heave, and updates boat.tau and boat.z_wl
boat.get_steady_trim()

boat.print_description()
```
